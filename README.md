About
==
This repo contains two implementations of Simplest Oblivious Transfer Protocol, described in a paper by Tung Chou and Claudio Orlandi and available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267.

The X86_64 assembly version from https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/simpleOT/ and a portable C version from https://github.com/dkales/SimplestOT_C. Both were added into this repo with bugfixes, compatibility improvements and bazel build support.
